# This are initial results for MLSTM-FCN architecture, without anti-overfitting measures
## Model
* Model based on MLSTM-FCN paper
* Specific architecture and weights TODO
## Training
* 50 epochs on Athena
* trained and validated on splits of "validation" data
## Notes
* Again, does not want to generalize from training to validation
* Slightly ~1% better accuracy than version with anti-overfitting measures
* Dev version can be trained to 95.5% on validation
